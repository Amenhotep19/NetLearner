# NetLearner
ASP .NET Core web app to allow any user to consolidate multiple learning resources all under 1 umbrella.

**Background**: As I've been doing a lot of R&D on ASP .NET Core, I found myself keeping track of blog posts, podcasts, YouTube videos, Twitch streams, Pluralsight tutorials, ebooks across Amazon, Safari Books Online, and so much more. I've been using Notepad, OneNote, browser bookmarks, Twitter lists, emails to myself, Google/Word docs and so much more just to keep track of URLs, notes and progress. I'm building this new app for myself to organize my learning plans, but also open-sourcing it and deploying it to allow others to use it too.

The name implies 2 things: the app's source code will be a real-world example for people learning .NET (specifically ASP .NET Core 2.1 and beyond), and the tool itself will help people learn any topic from various resources across the Internet.
